This blog is going to be about algorithms, particularly concerning
graphs and geometry. I intend to share some cool ideas, tricks and
techniques which I will learn over the course of my research and teaching.

One of the things I strive for is simplicity and explaining complex 
concepts in most easy to understand intuitive ways. The blog should
reflect that.
