\noindent\textbf{Education}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{University of Waterloo, Canada}\\
		Master of Mathematics in Computer Science \textit{(Fall 2013 - current)}\\
		CGPA : $93.2\%$

	\item \textbf{Indian Institute of Technology, (Banaras Hindu University) Varanasi, India}\\
		Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering \textit{(2006 - 2010)}\\
		CGPA : $8.69/10$
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Work Experience}
\begin{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Graduate Research Assistant, University of Waterloo}, Canada. \textit{(Sep 2013 - current)}\\
	My current research deals with finding interesting patterns in graphs arising from program traces. The broader
	goal is to design a practical algorithm for efficient pattern mining in special graph classes.

	\item \textbf{Senior Member Technical Staff, Mentor Graphics}, Noida, India. \textit{(July 2010 - Aug 2013)}\\
	Worked with Veloce compiler team. Responsibilities included developing efficient solutions for Mentor's 
	next generation emulation platform.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Selected Projects}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Computation of Treewidth} \textit{Google Summer of Code 2014, OGDF}
	\href{http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/sudo\_er/5717271485874176}{[1]}\\
	Treewidth is a metric to measure tree-likeness of a graph. The goal of the project was to implement some heuristics
	for computing treewidth and tree-decomposition of a graph and efficiently solve some NP-hard problems on graphs of
	bounded treewidth.
	\item \textbf{Shared Libraries on NUMA} \textit{Course Project} \\
	In this project, we performed a holistic analysis of shared library performance on NUMA architectures. We wrote an
	evaluation paper\href{http://sud03r.github.io/numa.pdf}{[2]} summarizing our observations.
	
	\item \textbf{A test framework for scummVM's subsystems } \textit{Google Summer of Code 2010, ScummVM}
	\href{http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2010/sudo\_er/5757334940811264}{[3]}\\
	The objective of this project was to enhance the ScummVM unit testing infrastructure by implementing a Game Engine that
	could could invoke and test various ScummVM subsystems in an integrated and non-isolated manner.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Technical Skills}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Programming languages}: C++(Proficient), C (Good), Perl (Good), shell-scripts (Good), php/java (basic)

	\item \textbf{Programming Tools}: GDB (Proficient), version control (git, svn, cvs), awk, sed, etc.  
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{Miscellaneous}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Teaching assistant} for CS341 : Algorithms; CS350 : Operating Systems and CS230 : Introduction to Computer Systems.
\end{itemize}
